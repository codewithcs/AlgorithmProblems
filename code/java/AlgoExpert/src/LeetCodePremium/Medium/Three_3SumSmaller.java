/*
Given an array of n integers nums and an integer target,
find the number of index triplets i, j, k with 0 <= i < j < k < n that
satisfy the condition nums[i] + nums[j] + nums[k] < target.

Follow up: Could you solve it in O(n^2) runtime?

Constraints:
n == nums.length
0 <= n <= 300
-100 <= nums[i] <= 100
-100 <= target <= 100
