/*
You are given a list of songs where the ith song has a duration of time[i] seconds.

Return the number of pairs of songs for which their
total duration in seconds is divisible by 60.

Formally, we want the number of indices i, j such that i < j
with (time[i] + time[j]) % 60 == 0.

Constraints:
1 <= time.length <= 6 * 10^4
1 <= time[i] <= 500
