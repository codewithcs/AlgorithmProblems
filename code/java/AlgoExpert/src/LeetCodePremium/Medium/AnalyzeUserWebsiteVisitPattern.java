/*
We are given some website visits: the user with name username[i]
visited the website website[i] at time timestamp[i].

A 3-sequence is a list of websites of length 3 sorted in
ascending order by the time of their visits.
(The websites in a 3-sequence are not necessarily distinct.)

Find the 3-sequence visited by the largest number of users.
If there is more than one solution, return the
lexicographically smallest such 3-sequence.

Note:
1. 3 <= N = username.length = timestamp.length = website.length <= 50
2. 1 <= username[i].length <= 10
3. 0 <= timestamp[i] <= 10^9
4. 1 <= website[i].length <= 10
5. Both username[i] and website[i] contain only lowercase characters.
6. It is guaranteed that there is at least one user who visited at least 3 websites.
7. No user visits two websites at the same time.
