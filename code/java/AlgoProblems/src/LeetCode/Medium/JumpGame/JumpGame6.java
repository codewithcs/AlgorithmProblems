package LeetCode.Medium.JumpGame;

/*
You are given a 0-indexed integer array nums and an integer k.

You are initially standing at index 0. In one move, you can jump at most k
steps forward without going outside the boundaries of the array.

That is, you can jump from index i to any index in the
range [i + 1, min(n - 1, i + k)] inclusive.

You want to reach the last index of the array (index n - 1).
Your score is the sum of all nums[j] for each
index j you visited in the array.

Return the maximum score you can get.

Constraints:
1 <= nums.length, k <= 10^5
-10^4 <= nums[i] <= 10^4
