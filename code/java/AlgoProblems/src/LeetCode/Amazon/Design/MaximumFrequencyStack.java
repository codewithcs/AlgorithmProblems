/*
Implement FreqStack, a class which simulates the operation of a stack-like data structure.

FreqStack has two functions:
push(int x), which pushes an integer x onto the stack.
pop(), which removes and returns the most frequent element in the stack.

If there is a tie for most frequent element, the element closest to the top of the stack is removed and returned.

Note:
Calls to FreqStack.push(int x) will be such that 0 <= x <= 10^9.
It is guaranteed that FreqStack.pop() won't be called if the stack has zero elements: Important Point to Note.

The total number of FreqStack.push calls will not exceed 10000 in a single test case.
The total number of FreqStack.pop calls will not exceed 10000 in a single test case.
The total number of FreqStack.push and FreqStack.pop calls will not exceed 150000 across all test cases
