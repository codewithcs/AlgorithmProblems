/*
Given strings S and T, find the minimum (contiguous) substring W of S, so that T is a subsequence of W.

If there is no such window in S that covers all characters in T, return the empty string "".
If there are multiple such minimum-length windows, return the one with the left-most starting index.

Note:
All the strings in the input will only contain lowercase letters.
The length of S will be in the range [1, 20000].
The length of T will be in the range [1, 100].
