/*
You want to build a house on an empty land which reaches all buildings in the shortest amount of distance. You can only move up, down, left and right. You are given a 2D grid of values 0, 1 or 2, where:

Each 0 marks an empty land which you can pass by freely.
Each 1 marks a building which you cannot pass through.
Each 2 marks an obstacle which you cannot pass through.

Note:
There will be at least one building in the given graph.
If it is not possible to build such house according to the above rules, return -1.
 */

/*
Approach:
1. Beats 98% 9ms JAVA BFS
2. Basically use lee-algroithm, bfs each 1 to find out min distance to each 0, accumulate this
distances to each 0 location: distance[][], finally find out min value from distance[][]
3. In the case of cannot find 0 from each house:

  4. not all 0s can reach each house: reachCount[][] to count the # of house each 0 can reach, only >= houseCount valid
  5. [~~improve speed~~]ï¼šnot all house can reach each house, in this case, we cannot build such house,
        -count reachable house #, if < houseCount, return -1 directly!!!!!
