/*
The numeric value of a lowercase character is defined as its position (1-indexed) in the alphabet,
so the numeric value of a is 1, the numeric value of b is 2, the numeric value of c is 3, and so on.

The numeric value of a string consisting of lowercase characters is defined as the
sum of its characters' numeric values. For example, the numeric value of the string "abe"
is equal to 1 + 2 + 5 = 8.

You are given two integers n and k. Return the lexicographically smallest string with length equal
to n and numeric value equal to k.

Note that a string x is lexicographically smaller than string y if x comes before y in dictionary order,
that is, either x is a prefix of y, or if i is the
first position such that x[i] != y[i], then x[i] comes before y[i] in alphabetic order

Constraints:
1 <= n <= 105
n <= k <= 26 * n

Input: n = 3, k = 27
Output: "aay"

n=5, k=73 => "aaszz"
